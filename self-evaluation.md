# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
  * The `each` method is a powerful tool, as it allows us to iterate through all the elements of an array and perform any number of actions on them. It could be useful for sorting data in ways that I likely can't even imagine as of yet.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
  * I need to get more comfortable with learning how to implement the variety of methods that are out there in ruby. There are more than I can possibly retain in my memory, so getting practice with understanding the uses of different methods will be key. I'm sure we'll have ample opportunity to do that in upcoming work!

- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
  * In this assignment, I reached out to one of my teammates in my small slack group to ask for assistance (they had posted earlier in the day that they were finished with assignments and available for help.) They were quickly able to diagnose why my code wasn't doing what I wanted it to do, and it was a relief to know it was such a small issue. I think that the social component of having teammates in this process will be hugely useful over my time at Turing.
